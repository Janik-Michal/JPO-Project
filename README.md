  The Digital Filter Library is a C++ library designed to provide easy-to-use tools
for implementing and working with digital filters in signal processing applications.
It includes classes for FIR (Finite Impulse Response) and IIR (Infinite Impulse Response)
filters, which are two of the most commonly used types of filters in digital signal processing.
  This library allows you to define your own filter coefficients, process input signals
through these filters, and obtain the filtered output.
